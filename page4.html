    <h1>How you can help with reducing water pollution.</h1>
    <p>1. Pick up litter and dispose of it properly.
One of the best ways to reduce water pollution is to prevent it at the source: by disposing of waste properly.
In fact, 60% of water pollution today can be attributed to litter</p>
<p>2. Don't pour fat and grease down the drain.
Most of the dishes we cook leave some sort of fat, oil, or grease residue behind. 
These substances should never be disposed of down the drain in your kitchen.

When poured down the drain, fat and grease can build up over time and clog your pipes. 
This will lead to sewer pipes clogging and even backing up into your yard and basement. 
It can also lead to water pollution by carrying contaminants to local bodies of water.

Instead, grease, fat, and used cooking oil should be disposed of in the trash or kept in a glass jar for disposal with other solid waste.</p>
<p>3.Use the minimum amount of laundry detergent
Laundry detergent and other cleaning products contain chemicals like phosphates that are harmful to our waters and marine life.

Phosphates lead to algae blooms and kill fish and other aquatic animals by reducing the oxygen in the water.
Soaps and detergents can also break up oil and send it lower into the water column, causing damage to more marine organisms.

When spilled in our waterways, soaps and detergents in and of themselves are actually a pollutant that may be harmful.

By cutting down on detergent, or using phosphate-free detergent, you can further cut down on water pollution from your own home.
There are plenty of effective natural laundry detergents that you can substitute for chemically-intensive detergents in your home.</p>
<p>4.Dispose of medical waste properly
Never flush pills, powders, or liquid medicines down the toilet or dump them outside, whether on land or water.
These drugs can accumulate in the water and be consumed by fish and other wildlifeHormones and other compounds end up causing a variety of health problems in fish and birds and contaminate drinking water that people and livestock use.

Studies have found that medicines flushed down the drain can contaminate our lakes and streams and eventually end up in our drinking water.
This can lead to adverse reactions for some people and even cases of accidental poisoning.</p>
